# SAMPLE WORK
Demonstrating two work items - firstly, <b>strategizing the migration</b> from templating engine to a modern JavaScript framework, and, secondly, how can we <b>improve the productivity</b> of the engineering department. Additionally, there is page dedicated to the architecture of this website.

# Strategy
Faced with an existing system that uses a coupled templating engine like Smarty or Twig how would you go about planning and executing a strategy for migrating the product to a headless frontend? Assume an existing PHP backend REST API is already available or can be extended to support it.

### Understanding Problem
As a first step, we would evaluate the need for the migration, its underlying implications, and if we are really ready to proceed.

### Migration Journey - Decoupled to Headless
Moving from monolithic/decoupled to headless would reduce technical operational risk and should also enhance flexibility, performance, customization, omnichannel experience, and future strategic growth.

### Building Blocks - Underlying Strategy
Strategizing a department-level migration involves contributions from all stakeholders including leadership, the product team, and the engineering team. Many decisions are part of this process, like appropriate technology, change management, impact on revenue, etc.

# Work Smarter
How can we double the productivity of our engineers (without trading job satisfaction, system availability, quality, or security)?

### Missing pieces of productivity
We often think about improving productivity, and whether it could be personal productivity or an organization's, it has the potential to exponentially improve well-being, sense of purpose, sustainability, and engagement.

# Architecture
Let's have a sneak peek on the high-level architecture of the website, and would really appreciate your feedback and queries!

### Core Building blocks
This website is hosted on Azure Static Web, empowered by Vue.js, Bulma CSS on front-end; node.js and expressjs as middle tier; and MongoDB as data store + data api + cognitive search for future scalability options.
